If we found a vulnerability in an out-of-scope smart contract which directly affects  an in-scope smart contract , is it an accepted issue ? i ask this because of  `` Areas of Interest

only the contracts in this list are in scope ?


it mentioned in below of the list to be aware of issue in operator and gatekeeper and other contracts which is not in the scope:

```
As the focus on this release was the Party contract, and all the contracts it inherits, we would highly recommend you at least be aware of each of these related contracts:

TokenDistributor (see here for known issues)
InitialETHCrowdfund
All gatekeeper contracts
All operator contracts
All proposal contracts

```

the decrease price model that is used for saleOption 2 is created by the team or is taked from some models


[11/01/2023 18:38] viraz4331
Hi @arr00 @0xble 
probably should be fixed in readme
`The file contracts/crowdfund/ReraiseETHCrowdfund.sol is out of scope. All files located in contracts/renderers are out of scope. All files not located within the contracts folder are also out of scope.` 
it should also mention all other contracts besides the 8 in scope contracts


[11/01/2023 19:02] 0k_sec
agreed, i mention it too

Hi @arr00  @0xble  I am getting the following error in foundry, how do I sort it out? ```Warning (3860): Contract initcode size is 93701 bytes and exceeds 49152 bytes (a limit introduced in Shanghai). This contract may not be deployable on Mainnet. Consider enabling the optimizer (with a low "runs" value!), turning off revert strings, or using libraries.```


[11/02/2023 02:16] arr00
This is just a warning so shouldn’t be an issue for the sake of auditing. It is likely a test contract that is over the size limit.


[11/02/2023 07:34] debofx

Parties and crowdfunds are minimal proxies. They are created by the crowdfund factory and party factory.

Hi @arr00 i am run forge test and it is taking so long to run, even with the optimize hint. Any tips on how to run forge test quicker. I am using a fork to alchemy.


[11/03/2023 12:46] brianle
Do you have --via-ir enabled by chance


[11/03/2023 15:15] debofx
I forget where this is. IS it in an .env file?


[11/03/2023 15:30] debofx
What do I change the following to?  viaIR: withOptimizations && argv.ir,


[11/03/2023 15:37] arr00
You want to have viaIR and optimizer off to speed up compilation. For testing they are off by default in the repo


[11/03/2023 15:56] debofx
I have added the via ir = false to foundry.  And I have left the above as is.  It was not in the foundry toml file.


[11/03/2023 15:56] debofx
Thanks.


[11/03/2023 15:56] debofx
Still running slowly but maybe it will run in 1 hour instead 5.


[11/03/2023 15:56] debofx
Never experience this so bad before.


[11/03/2023 16:06] j4x_98
If you don't need all the tests to run but just your own POC use the `--match-test` flag, this will only run your test


[11/03/2023 16:06] debofx
Yes, I have run match-path with match-test and it took hours and at the end I got a "Error solc error"


[11/03/2023 16:07] j4x_98
Thats weird, if i use the flag my POCs for this codebase run instantly like maybe 1-2 seconds


[11/03/2023 16:08] debofx
Then I will try just  `--match-test`.  Does this need to run in the subfolder for the test contract?


[11/03/2023 16:09] j4x_98
I just run with `forge test -vvvv --match-test "testcaseName"`

There were no changes to that file for this release so it wasn’t in scope. That said, if you do find a bug in it, im sure it interacts with in scope code in some way and we will be able to honor it.

Can anyone explain how to test the contract becuase I didnt use forge test before?


[11/06/2023 19:16] sweetcat0118
@arr00 Could you explain how to test the contract using forge from installing package to test?


[11/06/2023 19:17] arr00
yeah sure. Do you have forge installed?


[11/06/2023 19:17] sweetcat0118
yeah


[11/06/2023 19:18] arr00
Ok so after cloning make sure to run npm/yarn install and then `forge install`. Then everything should work


[11/06/2023 19:18] arr00

There is a note in the installation guide: 
```"If you're on Windows, you will need to install and use Git BASH or WSL, as your terminal, since Foundryup currently does not support Powershell or Cmd."```

what is the difference between the maxContribution and maxTotalContribution?

maxContribution is the maximum value which you can contribute at once, and maxTotalContribution is the crowdfund maximum contribution total which need to finalize crowdfund.

[11/07/2023 15:08] anjali_t
can we assign values while emiting event??


[11/07/2023 15:08] brianle
maxContribution limits how much can be contributed at a time, motivated by limiting how much voting power each card can have. maxTotalContribution is basically the max amount the crowdfund wants to raise, at which point it will be finalized and no one else can contribute

Yes

Is there a mechanism for limiting user's voting power?


[11/07/2023 15:38] brianle
No, the closest thing is min/max contribution in InitialETHCrowdfund but thats only during the crowdfund stage


[11/07/2023 17:50] jacobmartin0406
Can users transfer voting power directly?


[11/07/2023 17:55] danhapo
I think it's possible in way of transfer tokens with votingPower to the others.


[11/07/2023 18:15] brianle

How delegation exactly works? Let's say, those are votes: `A(2)`, `B(20)`, `C(200)`. When A delegates to B and B delegates to C, how much B and C have?


[11/08/2023 08:15] osmanozdemir1
B will have 2 delegatedVotingPower, 20 intrinsicVotingPower and `isDelegated` will be true. -> he will only vote with 2

C will have 20 delegatedVotingPower, 200 intrinsicVotingPower and isDelegetad will be false -> He will be able to vote with 220

Only intrinsic powers are delegated

why are the various contribute functions on `InitialETHCrowdfund.sol` marked as `onlyDelegateCall`? Where will these typically be called from?

Will be called from proxies. Prevents the logic contract itself from being used. In many if not all cases,`onlyDelegateCall` is added as precaution but is not actually necessary

Big congrats to everyone, this was definitely a tough contest.

I want to thank Allah first for his blessings on me and for letting me win this contest. Secondly, I want to thank the PartyDAO team (@arr00 @0xble) for the opportunity + helping answer all my questions during the contest, especially Brian. You guys rock

I wish you all a prosperous auditing career.

Tbh the outcome was shocking for me as this is my 2nd audit ever. I barely knew what a DAO is going into this audit, but I've been hacking breaking software for years and I guess that's what helped me significantly. The mindset and the way you look at software as an attacker are the same regardless of what you're hacking, it's the technologies/stacks that can change.
